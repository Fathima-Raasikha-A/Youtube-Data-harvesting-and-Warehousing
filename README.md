# Youtube-Data-harvesting-and-Warehousing
YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing is a project that intends to provide users with the ability to access and analyse data from vriuos YouTube channels. 
SQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit are used in the project to develop a user-friendly application that allows users to retrieve, save, and query YouTube data.

Libraries:The following libraries are reqiured for this project:

PYTHON: Python is a powerful programming language renowned for being easy to learn and understand. 
        Python is the primary language employed in this project for the development of the complete application, including data retrieval, processing, analysis, and visualisation.
          
GOOGLE API CLIENT:The googleapiclient library facilitates the communication with different Google APIs.
                  It helps to interact with YouTube's Data API v3, allowing the retrieval of essential information 

MONGODB: MongoDB is built on a scale-out architecture that has become popular with developers of all kinds for developing scalable applications with evolving data schemas. 
        As a document database, MongoDB makes it easy for developers to store structured or unstructured data in JSON-like format.
        
POSTGRESQL: PostgreSQL is an open-source, advanced, and highly scalable database management system (DBMS) known for its reliability and extensive features.
            It provides a platform for storing and managing structured data, offering support for various data types and advanced SQL capabilities.
            
STREAMLIT: Streamlit library was used to create a user-friendly UI that enables users to interact with the programme and carry out data retrieval and analysis operations.


YOUTUBE DATA SCRAPPING AND ITS ETHICAL PERSPECTIVE: When engaging in the scraping of YouTube content, it is crucial to approach it ethically and responsibly. Respecting YouTube's terms and conditions, obtaining appropriate authorization, and adhering to data protection regulations are fundamental considerations. The collected data must be handled responsibly, ensuring privacy, confidentiality, and preventing any form of misuse or misrepresentation. Furthermore, it is important to take into account the potential impact on the platform and its community, striving for a fair and sustainable scraping process. By following these ethical guidelines, we can uphold integrity while extracting valuable insights from YouTube data.
